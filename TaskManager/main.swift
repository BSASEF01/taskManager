 User should be able to delete a task.

 The program should display menu(s) listing all possible actions the user can take.
 The program should include error handling to account for incorrect user input.
 Each task should have:

 */

//This is good but we might want the due date to be assigned when we make a task. There are a couple reasons why we would want to change it. First, we wont have the due date tied to the task as it is currently. It would be nice to be able to access a date property from inside our task object. Second, if we leave this program running for a few days it will still be saying the date is two weeks from when we started the program.
let currentDate = Date()

let calendar = Calendar.current

let twodaysFromNow = calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: 14, to: currentDate)

let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
dateFormatter.dateFormat = "MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm"



//Missing options to list all tasks, list only completed tasks, and list only incomplete tasks
//Also might be nice to have the option to quit from the main menu

func mainMenu() {
    print("""
    1.to add a task, type "addTask"
    
    2.to remove a task, type "removeTask"
    
   "3.to check a task in, type "completedTask"
    
   "4.to check a task out, type "IncompletedTask"
""")
    //testing
    let userInput = readLine()!
    
    if userInput == "addTask"{
        addTask()
        
    } else if userInput == "removeTask" {
        removeTask()
        
    } else if userInput == "IncompletedTask"
    {
        Incomplted()
    } else if userInput == "completedTask"{
        complted()
    } else {
        mainMenu()
